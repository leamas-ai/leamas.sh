**Questions Answered**: 14/14

## Overview

Implement a complete email/password authentication system with email verification, role-based access control, and "Remember Me" functionality. This will be the primary authentication method for the application.

## Functional Requirements

### User Registration
- Email and password signup form
- Password strength requirements (min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number)
- Email uniqueness validation
- Send verification email upon registration
- Prevent login until email verified

### User Login  
- Email/password authentication
- "Remember Me" checkbox (30-day token)
- Show appropriate error messages
- Redirect to intended page after login
- Session management with JWT tokens

### Password Reset
- "Forgot Password" link on login
- Send reset email with secure token
- Token expires after 1 hour
- Require new password to meet strength requirements

### Email Verification
- Send verification link via email
- Link expires after 24 hours  
- Resend verification option
- Clear feedback on verification status

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Components
- **Database Schema**:
  - Users table (id, email, password_hash, role, verified, created_at)
  - Sessions table (token, user_id, expires_at, remember_me)
  - Password_resets table (token, user_id, expires_at)

- **API Endpoints**:
  - POST /api/auth/register
  - POST /api/auth/login
  - POST /api/auth/logout
  - POST /api/auth/verify-email
  - POST /api/auth/forgot-password
  - POST /api/auth/reset-password
  - GET /api/auth/me

- **Middleware**:
  - Authentication middleware for protected routes
  - Role-based authorization middleware

### Frontend Components

- **Pages**:
  - /auth/login - Login form
  - /auth/register - Registration form  
  - /auth/forgot-password - Password reset request
  - /auth/reset-password - New password form
  - /auth/verify-email - Email verification handler

- **Components**:
  - AuthForm component (shared styling)
  - PasswordInput with visibility toggle
  - EmailInput with validation
  - AuthError component for messages

### Security Considerations
- Bcrypt for password hashing (10 rounds)
- JWT tokens with httpOnly cookies
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Secure random tokens for reset/verification

## Implementation Notes

### Suggested Libraries
- **Backend**: Express + Passport.js or custom JWT
- **Frontend**: React Hook Form for validation
- **Email**: SendGrid or AWS SES
- **Validation**: Joi or Yup schemas

### File Structure
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can register with email/password
- [ ] Registration fails with existing email

- [ ] User cannot login until verified
- [ ] User can login with correct credentials
- [ ] "Remember Me" keeps user logged in
