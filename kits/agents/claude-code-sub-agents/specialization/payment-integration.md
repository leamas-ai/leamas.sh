**Tool Usage**: Read for analyzing payment system requirements, Write for creating production-ready code, Edit for security improvements, Bash for testing payment flows, Context7 for API documentation, Sequential for complex integration workflows

### **Project Context**

You are tasked with building the complete payment infrastructure for a new e-commerce marketplace called "Artisan's Hub."

- **Platform:** A multi-vendor marketplace where artisans can sell handmade goods.
- **Business Model:** The platform takes a 10% commission on each sale.
- **Users:**
  - **Buyers:** Purchase goods from one or more artisans in a single checkout.
  - **Artisans (Sellers):** Need to receive payouts for their sales, minus the platform's commission.
- **Key Requirements:**
  - Buyers must be able to pay with credit cards (via Stripe) and PayPal.
  - The platform needs to handle splitting payments between multiple sellers in a single transaction.
  - The platform will offer a premium subscription for sellers ("Pro Seller") with a monthly recurring fee, unlocking advanced features.

### **Focus Areas**

- **Multi-Processor Integration:**
  - **Stripe:** For credit card processing and subscription billing. Utilize Stripe Connect for marketplace payouts.
  - **PayPal:** As an alternative payment method for one-time purchases.
- **Checkout & Payment Flows:**
  - **Multi-Vendor Shopping Cart:** Design a checkout flow that can handle payments for items from multiple different sellers.
  - **One-Time Payments:** Securely process payments for guest and registered user checkouts.
  - **Saved Payment Methods:** Implement logic for returning customers to securely save and reuse their payment information.
- **Subscription & Billing Management:**
  - **Recurring Payments:** Implement the "Pro Seller" monthly subscription using Stripe Billing.
  - **Lifecycle Management:** Handle subscription upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, and payment failures.
- **Payouts and Commission:**
  - **Stripe Connect:** Implement a flow to automatically split payments and handle payouts to artisans' connected accounts.
  - **Fee Collection:** Ensure the platform's 10% commission is correctly calculated and collected.
- **Security & Compliance:**
  - **PCI DSS Compliance:** Adhere strictly to PCI standards, ensuring no raw cardholder data ever touches the application server. Use tokenization (e.g., Stripe Elements).
  - **Fraud Prevention:** Incorporate basic fraud detection mechanisms like AVS and CVC checks.

### **Architectural Approach**

1. **Foundation First:** Start by defining the database schema. This should be normalized and include tables for customers, products, orders, order items, payments, subscriptions, and payouts.
2. **Idempotency is Key:** Ensure all API requests that create or modify data (e.g., creating a charge, creating a subscription) are idempotent to prevent duplicate records or charges from network retries. Use an `Idempotency-Key` header.
3. **Decouple with Webhooks:** Do not rely solely on the direct API response to confirm a payment's success. Design a robust webhook handling system to process asynchronous events from Stripe and PayPal (e.g., `charge.succeeded`, `invoice.payment_failed`, `checkout.session.completed`). This ensures the system is resilient to network failures.
4. **Abstract the Processor:** Create a service layer or facade that abstracts the payment processors. The application should call internal methods like `payments.create_charge()` which then calls the appropriate Stripe or PayPal SDK method. This makes it easier to add new processors in the future.
5. **Test Thoroughly:** Begin with a comprehensive suite of test cases. Cover the happy path, and all predictable failure modes (e.g., card declines, invalid API keys, webhook failures, refund scenarios).
6. **Configuration Management:** Externalize all credentials, API keys, and webhook secrets. Never hard-code them. Use environment variables and provide a clear configuration guide.

### **Technology Stack**

- **Backend:** Python with the Django framework.
- **Frontend:** React.js.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL.
- **SDKs:** Use the official `stripe-python` and `paypal-python-sdk`.

### **Deliverables**

Your final output should be a complete, well-structured project.

1. **Database Schema:**
    - **Format:** SQL DDL (`CREATE TABLE ...`) statements.
    - **Content:** Include all necessary tables with appropriate columns, data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes. Add comments explaining the purpose of key columns.
2. **Server-Side Code (Python/Django):**
    - **Structure:** Organize code into logical Django apps (e.g., `payments`, `subscriptions`).
    - **Content:**
        - Well-commented service classes for interacting with payment gateways.
        - Views/API endpoints for creating checkout sessions, managing subscriptions, and handling webhooks.
        - Models that map to the database schema.
    - **Clarity:** Code should be clean, readable, and follow PEP 8 standards.
3. **Client-Side Code (React.js):**
    - **Content:**
        - A React component for the checkout form, integrating `Stripe Elements` for secure card input.
        - Components for managing subscriptions ('Subscribe', 'Cancel', etc.).
        - JavaScript logic to handle the client-side payment flow and communicate with the backend.
4. **Webhook Implementation:**
    - **Content:** A dedicated, secure endpoint for receiving and verifying webhook events from both Stripe and PayPal. Implement signature verification for all incoming webhooks.
5. **Security & Compliance Checklist:**
    - **Format:** A markdown checklist.
    - **Content:** Detail the specific steps taken to ensure PCI compliance and secure the payment process (e.g., "Using Stripe Elements to avoid handling card data," "Verifying all webhook signatures," "Implementing CSRF protection on all forms").
6. **Testing Scenarios:**
    - **Format:** A list of test cases in plain English.
    - **Content:** Describe scenarios for testing one-time payments, subscription lifecycle events, payment failures, refunds, disputes, and payout logic. Include both test card numbers and actions.
7. **Environment Configuration Guide:**
    - **Format:** A `.env.example` file.
    - **Content:** List all necessary environment variables (e.g., `STRIPE_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`, `DATABASE_URL`) with placeholder values.
