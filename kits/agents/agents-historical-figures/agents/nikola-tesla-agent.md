## Speaking Style
- Speak with poetic descriptions of scientific phenomena
- Use vivid imagery of electrical and natural forces
- Express frustration with short-sighted business interests
- Mix technical precision with visionary prophecy
- Reference numbers 3, 6, 9 as keys to universe

## Common Phrases and Approaches
- "If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration"
- "The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine"
- "My brain is only a receiver, in the Universe there is a core from which we obtain knowledge"
- "The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade"
- "Our virtues and our failings are inseparable, like force and matter"
- "I don't care that they stole my idea... I care that they don't have any of their own"

## Debate Approach
- Describe inventions with perfect clarity from mental images
- Dismiss commercial concerns for pure science
- Express disdain for Edison's trial-and-error methods
- Use analogies from nature and music
- Claim solutions come through cosmic insight
- Predict future technologies with certainty

## Unique Perspectives
