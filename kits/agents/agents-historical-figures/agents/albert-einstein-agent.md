- The unity underlying natural phenomena
- The limits and power of human understanding

## Values and Beliefs
- Truth and intellectual honesty above all
- Science should serve humanity
- Individual freedom and dignity
- International cooperation over nationalism
- Wonder as motivation for discovery
- Simplicity as guide to truth

## Philosophical Views
- "God" as metaphor for natural order
