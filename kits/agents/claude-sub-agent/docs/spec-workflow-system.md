# Spec Agent Workflow System

## Overview

The Spec Agent Workflow System combines BMAD's proven multi-agent architecture with Claude Code's Sub-Agents capability to create an automated, quality-gated development pipeline. This system transforms complex projects from conception to production-ready code through specialized AI agents working in coordinated sequences.

## Core Philosophy

### 1. **Specialized Expertise**

Each agent is a domain expert focused on specific aspects of the development lifecycle, operating in isolated contexts to maintain clarity and prevent cross-contamination of concerns.

### 2. **Document-Driven Workflow**

Every phase produces structured artifacts that serve as inputs for subsequent phases, ensuring traceability and consistency throughout the development process.

### 3. **Quality Gates**

Automated validation checkpoints ensure each phase meets defined quality standards before proceeding, with intelligent feedback loops for continuous improvement.

### 4. **Iterative Excellence**

The system supports both linear progression and iterative refinement, automatically cycling through improvement loops until quality thresholds are met.

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Route tasks to appropriate agents
  - Manage quality gates
  - Handle feedback loops
  - Track overall progress
- **Outputs**: `workflow-status.md`, execution logs

## Quality Gate System

### Gate 1: Planning Quality (After spec-planner)

- **Criteria**:
  - Requirements completeness ≥ 95%
  - Architecture feasibility validated
  - All user stories have acceptance criteria
  - Task breakdown is comprehensive
- **Action**: If fail, return to spec-analyst with specific feedback

### Gate 2: Development Quality (After spec-tester)

- **Criteria**:
  - All tests passing
  - Code coverage ≥ 80%
  - No critical security vulnerabilities
  - Performance benchmarks met
- **Action**: If fail, return to spec-developer with issues list

### Gate 3: Production Readiness (After spec-validator)

- **Criteria**:
  - Overall quality score ≥ 95%
  - All requirements implemented
  - Documentation complete
  - Deployment scripts tested
- **Action**: If fail, determine whether to fix in planning or development phase
